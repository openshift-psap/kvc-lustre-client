# kvc-lustre-client

This is a [kmods-via-containers](https://github.com/kmods-via-containers/kmods-via-containers)
implementation for the lustre-client kernel module built by AWS for AWS FSx for Lustre. This is meant to be used by
[Special Resource Operator](https://github.com/openshift-psap/special-resource-operator) to use the Lustre filesystem
on OpenShift, with the AWS FSx CSI driver.
